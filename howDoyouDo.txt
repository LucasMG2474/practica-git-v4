I see you comb your hair, and gimme that grin
It's making me spin now, spinning within
Before I melt like snow, I say hello
How do you do?

I love the way you undress now, baby begin
Do your caress, honey, my heart's in a mess
I love your blue eyed voice, like Tiny Tim shines thru
How do you do?

Beautyful song
